# Feasability of operating a Bike Sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa

## New York City has been running a very succesful Bike Sharing program, CitiBike, since 2013. And we believe that there is potential to run a similar program sucessfully in the Des Moines city of Iowa. The mechanics of making this business work in Des Moines may be quiet different than that of New York City. And thus we have analyzed some key factors to explore the potential for a bike sharing program to operate in the city of Des Moines.

## The most important entity in any business is customers
#### Thus, we have decided to analyze the demand potential in this section of the study and will be exploring and analyzing the following question:
### Q: What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

### - The link to the Tableau story is given below and we will be walking through it's different sections in detail:

#### Dashboard #1 (Population Growth):
The overall population of the city forms the pool of potential users. Besides analyzing the overall size of the pool, it is also important on analyze any increasing or decreasing trends in the city's population as that impacts the sustainability and growth of the business.
Also, it is important to compare the New York population with Des Moines population to understand the possible scale and scope of new operations when compared with NYC Citibike.

#### Dashboard #2 (Population Density):
Population density supports bike-share demand. Higher population density correlates with less automobile dependence and higher use of alternative transportation choices.
Higher density areas have increased chances of traffic congestion due to automobiles and makes biking a more feasible choice.
Higher density also improves accessibility, which reduces travel distances and makes non-motorized travel more feasible.
