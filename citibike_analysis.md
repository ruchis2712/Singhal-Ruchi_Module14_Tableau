# Feasability of operating a Bike Sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa

## New York City has been running a very succesful Bike Sharing program, CitiBike, since 2013. And we believe that there is potential to run a similar program sucessfully in the Des Moines city of Iowa. The mechanics of making this business work in Des Moines may be quiet different than that of New York City. And thus we have analyzed some key factors to explore the potential for a bike sharing program to operate in the city of Des Moines.

## *__The most important entity in any business is customers__*
=========================================================================
#### Thus, we have decided to analyze the demand potential in this section of the study and will be exploring and analyzing the following question:
### Q: What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
=========================================================================
### - The link to the Tableau story is given below and we will be walking through it's different sections in detail:
### Des Moines Bike-Sharing (CitiBike) Analysis(https://public.tableau.com/profile/ruchi7973#!/vizhome/Module14_Challenge/Story1?publish=yes)

#### Dashboard #1 (Population Growth):
The overall population of the city forms the pool of potential users. Besides analyzing the overall size of the pool, it is also important to analyze any increasing or decreasing trends in the city's population as that impacts the sustainability and growth of the business.
Also, it is important to compare the New York population with Des Moines population to understand the possible scale and scope of new operations when compared with NYC Citibike.

#### Dashboard #2 (Population Density):
Population density supports bike-share demand. Higher population density correlates with less automobile dependence and higher use of alternative transportation choices.
Higher density areas have increased chances of traffic congestion due to automobiles and makes biking a more feasible choice.
Higher density also improves accessibility, which reduces travel distances and makes non-motorized travel more feasible.

#### Dashboard #3 (Customer Type):
As is evident from CitiBike NYC August 2019 bike-sharing data, 81% customers are annual subscribers. Which means that bike sharing is most used by local residents. 19% of customers are not annual subscribers which may include visitors / tourists to NYC

#### Dashboard #4 (Impact of Tourism):
As stated above, 19% of non-subscribing customers may include vistors/tourists. And in the light of the fact that Des Moines annual vistors number is manyfold its local population number, this may be an important customer segment to focus on, specially in the months of June-September when the tourism is at its peak.

#### Dashboard #5 (Impact of Age):
On analyzing CitiBike NYC August 2019 bike-sharing data, we found that average trip duration increases as age decreases.
Also, student markets are a likely population for bike-sharing. Thus, it is important to analyze the age demographics of the population.

#### Dashboard #6 (Other influencing factors):
Other important factors to consider are:

##### (1) the Retail Square Footage per Capita: 
That shows how far residents may have to travel outside of their work for shopping/leisure etc.

##### (2) Mean travel time to work & Average length of trips: 
These are important factors to consider as in New York City due to population density, automobile travel time (given traffic congestion), high parking cost, and availability of public transport; people prefer public transport to travel to work and need to travel the short distance from their homes to Subway stations etc. Thus, bike transport becomes a very viable option in such a situation. It is important to assess the mean travel time to work along with, average length of trips and other factors to understand the travel needs of people and available competing options
